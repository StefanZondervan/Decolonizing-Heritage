This is the first photo that I ever saw of him when I was 19, it's him and my grandma on the left. It was a really weird sensation because as soon as I saw the picture I realised I looked like him. I don't know that much about him apart from the fact that he was a con artist, a prick and that we share love for reading. I'm okay with looking like him on the outside, but I wouldn't want to be anything like him otherwise.</div>

Together with my grandfather and his two brothers, he passed through several countries, leaving everything behind in search of safety and better life, eventually settling in Bulgaria. His journey, filled with uncertainty and hardship has been passed down to me through family stories.Even though I never met him, his decisions and sacrifices are a core part of me and my families identity.</div>

                    <div class="card-description">Among the many rituals that speak to our shared spiritual heritage, the Abhishek — the sacred act of bathing a deity — holds a special place. Traditionally performed by pouring water, milk, or other offerings over a Lingam, it is not about cleansing the divine, for the divine is pure. Instead, it is a symbolic act of cleansing oneself — of purifying the heart, mind, and soul. Years ago, I gave my father a Lingam as a gift. It may seem simple, but for me, this gesture carries profound meaning. Throughout my life, my relationship with my father has been marked by few words and little direct connection. We rarely speak, and when we do, our conversations are brief. But this object — this sacred symbol — has showed a bridge between us. In its presence, I feel we are connected at a deeper level, beyond the need for many words. It represents not only spiritual devotion but also an unspoken bond, a quiet understanding that perhaps was always there...</div>

Growing up in Tunisia, I carried a lot of heavy emotions: the feeling of being stuck, of wanting to run away and find peace somewhere else. I was never trained or professional, but I didn’t need to be. Music became my safe space, my way of letting go, and my way of making sense of everything I was going through. Each song I make is a piece of my story — it’s raw, real, and it’s the only way I’ve truly been able to express who I am.</div>

                    <div class="card-description">A part of my mental heritage is the idea of aylyak — a Plovdiv state of mind that’s all about taking it easy and enjoying life. It’s more than being lazy — it’s about slowing down, being present, and finding joy in simple things. I grew up around this vibe: no one rushing, everything had its time, and there was always space for laughter, food, and connection. It taught me not to stress too much and to appreciate the moment. Whether you call it aylyak or just chilling with your friends, it’s a way of life I carry with me.</div>
