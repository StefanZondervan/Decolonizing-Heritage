This is the first photo that I ever saw of him when I was 19, it's him and my grandma on the left. It was a really weird sensation because as soon as I saw the picture I realised I looked like him. I don't know that much about him apart from the fact that he was a con artist, a prick and that we share love for reading. I'm okay with looking like him on the outside, but I wouldn't want to be anything like him otherwise.</div>

Together with my grandfather and his two brothers, he passed through several countries, leaving everything behind in search of safety and better life, eventually settling in Bulgaria. His journey, filled with uncertainty and hardship has been passed down to me through family stories.Even though I never met him, his decisions and sacrifices are a core part of me and my families identity.</div>

It‚Äôs more than being lazy ‚Äî it‚Äôs about slowing down, being present, and finding joy in simple things. I grew up around this vibe: no one rushing, everything had its time, and there was always space for laughter, food, and connection. It taught me not to stress too much and to appreciate the moment.
